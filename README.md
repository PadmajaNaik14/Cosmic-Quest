The project aims to develop an interactive survival game that challenges players to navigate 
through space while implementing various programming concepts in the building of the logic 
behind the program. The game is written in python. Players will have the option to choose from 
different characters and complexities in their power, with the objective of reaching the end of 
the path and reaching home safely in one piece. The program contains various decisions the 
player has to take that are encountered in the way.
